The goal of the game is to collect lines from balls of the same color. <br> The longer the line, the more points are awarded for it.<br>
You can move the balls between the cells, if between them there is a way free from the other balls.<br>
With the first tap you select the ball, then select the destination. The game continues until the board is full.<br>
Pleasant entertainment!
